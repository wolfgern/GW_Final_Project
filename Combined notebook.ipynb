    "# KRAB-ZFP ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and evolutionary conservation analysis using Python scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "KrÃ¼ppel-associated box zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs) constitute the largest transcription factor family in mammals. While most transcription factors bind relatively short DNA sequences present in the genome in thousands of copies, KRAB-ZFPs use a modular DNA binding domain, consisting of up to several dozen individual C2H2-type zinc fingers, allowing highly specific binding to long stretches of DNA that are unlikely to appear by chance. This mode of DNA binding, together with their KRAB repressor domain, enables KRAB-ZFPs to accurately and potently silence target genes. Interestingly, the KRAB-ZFP family rapidly amplified and diversified in mammals by segmental gene duplications, mutations, and zinc finger rearrangements. Recent evidence suggests that KRAB-ZFP diversification reflects an ongoing arms race between the host and transposable elements (TEs) that continuously invade and amplify within their host genomes. While this hypothesis might explain some aspects of KRAB-ZFP function and evolution, many questions remain open.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these questions, we initiated a medium-scale screen to identify the genome-wide binding sites of more than 50 previously uncharacterized mouse KRAB-ZFPs. Additionally, we gereated five KRAB-ZFP cluster KO ES cell lines, altogether genetically deleting nearly 100 KRAB-ZFPs. These cell lines were thoroughly analyzed by ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and other approaches. Additionally, we generated two cluster KO mouse lines in which we peformed RNA-seq in various tissues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Aim\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate simple, fast and reporoducible workflows, I wrote several Python scripts that process data that were generated other tools such as Bowtie, MACS14, DESeq and various Bedtools functions. The final goal is to to combine all scripts in one single program that processes raw ChIP-seq and RNA-seq files to generate publication-ready figures. However, some of these datasets are very big and the incorporation of other tools (which often take a long time to run) into a single Python script is challenging. Therefore, for now, I will use pre-written computational tools such as Bowtie and MACS14 in commandline, using awk commands and custom unix shell executables files in order to process a large amount of data efficiently and in relatively short time (e.g. mapping a typical ChIP-seq file using Bowtie, including sam to bam conversion and sorting of the final output file, takes less than 10 minutes when using 24 processors on our local server.) The aim for each of the developed Python scripts is explained in more detail below, including a workflow scheme that lists all other tools that are required to generate the input files for the Python scripts.\n"

    "\n",
    "I used Bowtie (--best mode) to map ChIP-seq fastq files to the mouse genome (mm9) and MACS14 (-p 1E-10) to call regions with significant enrichment of ChIP sample vs Input control (peaks). MACS14 reports the results as excel files that contain all ChIP-seq peak information. The purpose of this code is to filter out peaks that are less than 20-fold enriched over Input and to add an additional column that states the KRAB-ZFP from for which the ChIP-seq peaks have been determined. The results are saved as one concatenated bed file for further processing.                                                            "

    "# 4. Discussion and outlook\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a powerful programming language to perform computational analysis of data generated by next generation sequencing technologies. The short scripts described above can significantly shorten the time it takes to process data files generated by programs previously developed for ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. Importantly, the scripts can be re-used when more next generation sequencing data is constantly produced over the course of a project. In my case, I started with only a handful of ChIP-seq data but these datasets kept growing for more than two years. The developed scripts will help me to analyse new data in very little time in a reproducible manner. I also have previously spent a lot of time to generate RNA-seq scatter plots using excel which is not only time consuming and often leads to a crash of excel because of the large amounts of data, but is also not very useful when trying to generate figures from several datasets. The very short and simple python script to create scatter plots from DESeq2 output files is therefore a very helpful tool for me. \n",
    "Finally, the script that extracts contact amino  acids from C2H2 zinc finger proteins, although already proven to be useful for my specific purposes, could be extended in several ways. One interesting possibility would be to use an improved version to screen entire genomes for the presence of these C2H2 proteins and provide various information about the matches. Such a script could load batched of sequenced genomes (ideally without the need to save the data locally), translate the DNA sequence to protein in all 6 possible open reading frames, and screen the protein sequences for C2H2 fingers. Furthermore, such a script could easily be modified to look for all kind of protein or DNA motifs in a large number of genomes.\n",
    "The next logical step is to combine all the individual scripts in one programm that is able to receive files from other programs, potentiall not written in Python, process the files, return them to a new program and so on. That way, one could generate a pipeline that creates final figures from the raw sequencing files in one run. Nevertheless, since some of the processing steps are time consuming (e.g. mapping), it might make sense to split the script in two or more pieces."
